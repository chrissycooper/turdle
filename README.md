# turdle
Turdle is a one-player game very similar to Wordle. 
This repo is associated with the [Refactor Tractor - 1 Day Challenge activity](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/turdle.html).

All five iterations were completed including: implementing a GET request to fetch the possible words from an API, refactoring and adding to an existing codebase, and implementing a POST request to track game data that persists on pageload and display it to the user.

## Set Up

2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine.
